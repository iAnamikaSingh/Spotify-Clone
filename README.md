# 🎵 Spotify Clone

## Introduction
This is a **Spotify Clone** built using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  
The purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate skills in structuring a webpage with HTML and styling it with modern CSS techniques.

This clone replicates the look and feel of Spotify’s web player interface, including:
- A responsive layout
- Music player controls


⚠️ **Note:** This is a front-end design only — no JavaScript functionality for actual music playback is included.
